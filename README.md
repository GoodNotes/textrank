A Swift package that implements the ['TextRank' algorithm](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf) for summarization and keyword extraction.
It is based off of the [original Python implementation](https://github.com/summanlp/textrank).

Stop words were acquired from [Ranks NL](https://www.ranks.nl/stopwords).
Please open an issue to request additional language support.
